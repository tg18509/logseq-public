## Kapeli Dash
	- Dash is the undisputed champion. I learned about the application in late 2013, meaning that it has played a pivotal role throughout the entirety of my developer journey.
	- In the video below I provide a look into what it actually looks like when i use the application.
		- I use my hotkey, `ctrl-d`, to summon dash from the shadows.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- `cmd+l` gets my cursor focused into the search bar.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Rather than write out "javascript" or "reactjs" or "tailwindcss", I use two-letter identifiers that I configure immediately after downloading a docset.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- > *javascript --> js*
	  *reactjs --> re*
	  *tailwindcss --> tw*

- ## Warp
	- Warp terminal came into my life pretty soon after it was initially released. It boasted great performance, and it has held up it's end of the bargain. Also, I recently received a surge of people signing up with my referall link which led to me acquiring a very comfy t-shirt in addition to some stickers. If that's not defensibility, I'm not sure what is.
